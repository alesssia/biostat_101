# An introduction to data literacy 

Material for a ~15h *Stats 101/data literacy* introductory course for nursing and other medical-related students.

All material (slides, teacher notes, etc) is in Italian, the language I'm delivering the course in, and it's likely plenty of typos. Hopefully they will be fixed -- and the material improved, at each iteration.
