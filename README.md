# An introduction to data literacy 

Material for a ~15h *Stats 101/data literacy* introductory course for nursing and other medical-related students.

All material (slides, teacher notes, etc) is in Italian, the language I'm delivering the course in, and it's likely plenty of typos. Hopefully they will be fixed -- and the material improved, at each iteration. 

## Topics covered


## Schedule

The course will be delivered with different schedules (4x4h slots, 5x3h slots, or 6x2h slots), therefore, the lesson material is divided into topics 

## Sources

While I consulted multiple sources for creating this material, these are the most prominent:

- Spiegelhalter, D., *The Art of Statistics: Learning From Data*, Pelican, 2019
- Wayne D.W., and Cross C.L.. *Biostatistics: a foundation for analysis in the health sciences*. Wiley, 2018
- Pagano M., and  Gauvreau K., *Principles of biostatistics*, Chapman and Hall/CRC, 2022
- Bergstrom C.T., and West J.D., *Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World*, Random House, 2020 


## Acknowledgements 

I'd like to thank Profs Paola Dalmasso, Paola Berchialla, and Lorena Charrier who shared their teaching material and a lot of wisdom with me.
